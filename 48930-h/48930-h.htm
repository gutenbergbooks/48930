<h2 class="p4">Life of Stephen H. Branch.</h2>

<p class="p2">John Horsewell was a poor boy, and had
duck legs. My brother William was taller
and older than John, and had a new suit of
clothes, with which I clad John from head to
foot. Bill’s hat and boots were too large for
John, and his coat on John nearly grazed the
ground. I put on my Sunday suit, and off we
went to Boston, forty miles distant. We quarrelled
on the road, in a deep wood, and I demanded
John to take off Bill’s clothes, at
which he called me hard names, and I left
him, and directed my steps towards Providence,
leaving him reclining on the embankment
of the forest road. I wandered half a
mile at a quick and revengeful pace; but as
twilight was approaching, and I heard the
bark of a dog, with lungs of thunder, I became
alarmed, and hurried back to John, and
craved his pardon, and we lingered until the
stage arrived, when we took passage for Boston,
reaching the Marlboro’ Hotel at midnight.
Mr. Barker was the host, and, on our inquiry
for lamps to retire, he exclaimed: “Who are
you, and whence came you?” John was disconcerted,
but I was cool, and replied: “Our
names are Branch and Horsewell, and we are
from Providence.” “Did you visit Boston
with the permission of your father and
mother?” “No, sir.” “You ran away, then?”
“No, sir; we walked away.” “What can
you do in Boston in your clouts?” “Learn a
trade, sir.” “Have you any money?” “Forty
cents, sir.” “Bob: Take these brats to your
room, and make a bunk on the floor, and lock
the door, and watch their movements closely
until morning, when I will put them in the
poor house or county jail.” And off we
tramped to bed, up four flights of stairs, and
were locked in until Bob came to bed, when
we snored terribly, pretending to be in a doze
so profound, that a cannon could not arouse us.
John cried all night, and at daylight we
crawled softly from our hard nests, while Bob
was asleep, and softly turned the key, and descended
the stairs in our stockings, and fled
for our lives. We went to the market, and
got a cheap breakfast, and then sought the
theatre, where we saw Mac Cready announced
as “Hamlet.” We ardently desired to go,
but had not sufficient money; and away we
trudge to Brattle street, and exchange our
new clothes for worthless rags, with five dollars
besides. We then return to the theatre,
and linger on its steps until the performance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
begins, when we purchase tickets, and rush,
with about forty negroes, up stairs into the
gallery, like a gang of maniacs, (so wild was
our common joy,) where we witness a vast
plain of woolly heads that resemble the
Black Sea. The heat was intense, and we
perspired like cotton slaves, and the stench
was as intolerable as cholera malaria. During
the day, we engaged lodgings with a little colored
barber, opposite the theatre, for nine-pence
each a night. At the close of the performance
we thumped a long period before he
let us in, and then we found him partially intoxicated.
In the morning, we strolled on the
Common, and John became homesick, and besought
me to return to Providence; and he
cried and implored so hard, that I yielded;
and while engaging our passage, a young man
named James Baker recognised us, and desired
me to remain in Boston under his protection,
to which I assented, but John departed
for Providence. I went to board with Jim
Baker in Theatre Alley, with Mrs. Charnock,
a superannuated actress, and afterwards at the
Sun Tavern and other places, for which we
did not pay our board, and walked to Salem,
where I wrote to father for money, which he
sent me, and I returned to Providence. He
received me with intense affection, and I
wept with commingled joy and sorrow at my
return, and his anguish at my dishonorable
absence. At about ten years old, John Horsewell
and myself stole some pigeons from Dexter
Spencer’s barn, and we were caught with
them in our hats. Father took my hand, and
led me to the wharf, where ships could float,
and suspended me over the water, until I had
a slight fit, when he carried me home. It was
baking day, and aunt Lucy was very angry
because he did not drown me, and in her
wrath, while he was absent, she took out the
pies and brown bread, and put me in the oven
head foremost, and nearly baked me. A few
seconds more in the oven, and I would have
smothered. I told father when he came to
dinner, and he boxed Aunt Lucy’s ears severely,
and demanded her to instantly surrender
the dress and bonnet he gave her the day previous.
But she cried so hard, and wrung her
hands so piteously, that he soon restored them,
lest she would have cramps in the stomach,
with which she was often dangerously afflicted,
through her excessive fondness for cheese
and hard-shell clams, of which she often ate
until she could scarcely breathe. A month
later, I stole some peaches and currents from
Captain Prouds’ garden, and old junk and iron
from the ship yards. Father was a Justice of
the Peace, and took me to jail, and put me in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
cell; but I screamed so fearfully, that he restored
me to liberty in about five minutes;
and when I emerged from the dungeon, I
sprang upon his bosom, and kissed him as tenderly
as a cow laps her calf, and I also kissed
the turnkey, whose keys terribly scared me.
I soon went to a country boarding school, and
terrified the farmers for miles around, who
petitioned father to come after me, who visited
the unsophisticated countrymen, and strove
to tranquilise their nerves with the assurance
that I would not contaminate their children,
nor desolate their fields and orchards, and
that it was the crows and not me that pilfered
their early crops of fruits and vegetation.
But they shook their heads, and besought him
to restore the wonted quiet and confidence of
the parish, by my immediate departure for
some distant region. Father succumbed, and
we left for Providence, where I became the
very youthful clerk of Norman White, who is
now an extensive type and paper merchant in
Beekman street, with whom I remained until
I left for New York with Jim Baker in the
steamer Washington, Captain Bunker, concealing
ourselves in the water closets until the
boat passed Newport, when we appeared on
deck, and strutted as boldly and proudly as
Robert Macaire and his companion. But the
Captain soon discovered us to be impostors,
and made us pass pine wood to the firemen for
our passage. Jim was older and stronger than
me, and the Captain and first mate made him
work like a slave; but I was seasick, and
vomited dreadfully all over the deck, and the
firemen, and passengers; and as the Captain
slowly passed me, I belched a copious
volley of the most bitter bile plumply in his
face, for which he severely shook me, and
made me express my sorrow for the dire calamity
and apparent insult, and drove me down
below, where I implored the Cook to throw me
overboard, and relieve me from my deathly
sickness. The nigger Cook laughed uproariously
over my misfortunes, and declined my
request, and brought me a stew composed of
pork, molasses, and onions, for my dinner;
and, as I smelt, and inhaled, and gazed upon
the nauseous dish, I let fly a torrent of bile
into the darkey’s face, who run for his life,
and molested me no more during the voyage,
and I never saw Sambo again. We arrived in
New York, at Fulton market, and went to
Holts’ Eating House, and ate heartily, and Jim
Baker went in pursuit of work as a segar
maker, and I tagged on behind. He got employment,
and we boarded in Fulton street,
near Broadway. I soon got a situation as bar
keeper, with Mr. Saunders, in Laurens street,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
next to the theatre, and soon afterwards went
a few doors above, in the basement, as bartender
for Mr. Gilman. I then became a
waiter in a New York and Albany steamboat,
and afterwards in a Hartford steamer. I then
went to an Intelligence office (whoso proprietor
strove to cheat me), and for 50 cents got a situation
with Wm. Chapman, No. 60 Pine street,
at $2 a week, and boarded in Water street,
near Beekman. Wm. H. Stansbury was Mr.
Chapman’s book-keeper, who left soon after I
came, and went with James Brooks, of the
“<i>New York Express</i>,” as book-keeper, where he
is now. This was in 1826. My duties consisted
in helping William Chapman softly draw his
coat over his rheumatic shoulders, and going
to the Post Office, and copying letters. I told
Mr. Chapman that I had to pay two dollars a
week for board, and that he must increase my
salary, or I could not remain. He said that
he could get a boy for less than two dollars a
week, and I left him, and got a place with two
brothers, named Morton, in Front street, for
two dollars and twenty-five cents a week.
While passing the sailor hat store of Mr.
Leary, Mr. Leary’s mother called me into the
store, and said: “Little boy, if you will take
this bottle, and go to the grocery and get me
some gin, I will give you some pennies.”
When I returned with the gin, she asked me
if I would like to be a clerk for Mr. Leary. I
said that I would come for my board and
clothes. She told me to call in the evening
and arrange the compensation with Mr. Leary,
who would then be in the store. I did so,
and on the following day I told the Messrs.
Morton that I must leave them, as two dollars
and twenty-five cents a week could not
buy my food and clothes, and pay for washing
my two shirts and two pairs of stockings. Mr.
Leary, his wife, mother, children, and myself,
were packed like pork in two small rooms in
the rear of the store, which were used as
kitchens, bed-rooms, parlors, wash-rooms and
everything else, which rendered the atmosphere
slightly dense and foggy, and perhaps
impure, and in the night we often had
skull collisions, and tumbled over each
other, which strongly resembled a rough and
tumble cabin scene in a terrific storm. I
might have endured all this, but to make
fires, open store, sell hats to drunken sailors,
run errands, and take care of squalling children,
so taxed my patience, and wasted my
pale and naturally delicate form, that I resolved
to leave instanter, and, with the Pilgrim’s
heavy burden, away I flew in pursuit of employment.
Mr. Leary now keeps a hat store in
the Astor House, whose boys are wealthy merchants
in Exchange Place, whom I often remind
of the days when I bore them in my
arms, and spanked them when they squalled.
From Leary’s I went to the Harpers in Cliff
street, and was placed in the pressing and
folding room, in the upper story. I boarded
with Fletcher (the youngest of the Harpers)
in Batavia street, between James and Roosevelt.
The firm then consisted of John, James,
and Wesley Harper. Fletcher was the foreman
of the composing room, (where I was
ultimately placed), who corrected my earliest
errors in the printer’s stick&mdash;and a precious
job he had of it&mdash;consuming more of his valuable
time than my composition was worth.
Fletcher was a fireman, and recently married,
and rather wild, and had two children, one of
whom was the partner of Raymond, Wesley and
Jones, of the “<i>New York Daily Times</i>,” at the
origin of that Journal, whom I often fondled in
my arms in his infancy, who was a very pretty
child, though rather lively for one so extremely
young, whose extraordinary vivacity I attributed
to worms. Wesley Harper was incomparably
modest and susceptible in those
days, and visited and married a lady residing
with Fletcher, who was connected with his
wife. While they were courting up stairs,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
the servant girl, myself, and other apprentices
often annoyed them with our funny
tricks; but Wesley and Fletcher did not dare
complain of us to John and James Harper, as
the courtship of Wesley was without the
knowledge of the elder Harpers. The servant
of Fletcher imparted to us this precious
secret, and we long teased the timid lovers
with impunity, in which the mischievous
servant participated with great hilarity.</p>

<h2>Stephen H. Branch’s Alligator.</h2>

<hr class="full2" />

<p class="pc mid">NEW YORK, SATURDAY, MAY 1, 1858.</p>

<hr class="full3" />

<p><span class="smcap">Listen!</span>&mdash;On Saturday last we arose with
the glorious sun, and went to our printing
office, and found the printer’s devil asleep in
his dingy bunk. We applied a bodkin, and he
sprang at us like a tiger. We grappled, and
discovering that he had an Editorial Alligator
by the throat, he released his grasp. We then
banged the gong, and the printers appeared,
like the imps in Robert the Devil, from the infernal
regions. We then placed our leviathan
form on the press, and lit the faggots, and
puff, puff, went the machinery, like the drums
and trumpets in Musard’s Express Train Gallop.
We filled our carpet bag with Alligators,
and flew like a whirlwind to the wholesale
newspaper merchants in Beekman, Nassau,
and Ann streets, where we found a plumed
battalion awaiting the advent of the Alligator.
The wholesalers, and retailers, and newsboys
approached us in platoons, and clasped our fervent
hands until they squeezed them into icicles,
and we cried for quarter, and returned to our
printing office, for another carpet bag of Alligators,
which we sold on our way to Ann
street, and returned again, and again, and yet
again, for Alligators, until the weary sun retired
to his downy bed in the bleak peach and
potato fields of the Jerseys. Our printing
office was besieged throughout the day, for
Alligators, and on our return from Ann street
the second time, we found our office stairs so
thronged with applicants for Alligators, that
we had to meander a dark alley, and ascend a
ladder, and enter our office through a window.
During the day, several bloody collisions transpired
on the stairs, between the newsboys, in
their struggles for the Alligators, as they
emanated from our electric presses; and in one
of the desperate conflicts, the Police were summoned
to preserve the public peace. And, altogether
it was a most laborious and exciting
day for us, and at early twilight we were
weary and worn, and retired soon after the
curfew strains expired on the evening air.
But we had an awful nightmare, in which we
soliloquised in tones so stentorian, (about newsboys
and Alligators,) as to arouse and terrify
a venerable nervous gentleman in the next
apartment, who thought we were either fighting
or dying, and he rapped against the wall
with his poker until he awoke us. While on
the eve of our emergence from the nightmare,
we dreamed that a colossus spider was devouring
our proboscis, at which we levelled a
Hyer blow,</p>

<p class="ppn4 p1">When pure blood oozed from our nose,<br />
Like water from Sikesy’s hose,</p>

<p class="pn1">which aroused us, and we darted into the bath
room, and applied the healing Croton without
effect, and had to dam our nostrils with putty,
which checked the copious effusion of blood,
but which made us talk in nosy and twangy
accents. In about an hour, the putty became
thoroughly saturated and drippy, and we had
to make fresh applications, and ultimately
the putty dam was victorious. But our eyes
are rather crimson, and we have fearful rumbling
sounds in our ears, resembling distant
thunder, and the bugle in the mountains, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
we fear our nostrils are in a state of inundation,
and that our blood will effect a passage
through our eyes or ears, and rush wildly into
the open air. But we checked the blood,
and leaped into our couch, and off we went,
like a patriotic rocket, into a slumber like
that of the pure and sweet Amena, in the
chamber of Rudolpho, and was no farther molested
with horrible dreams of the newsboys
and Alligators.</p>

<h2>Fra Diavolo and his Italian Brigands.</h2>

<p class="p2">Three hundred and sixteen thousand dollars
have been drawn from the Municipal Treasury,
for printing the worthless Records of the
County Clerk’s office, and nearly as much for
the Register’s Records. Who got the $550,000
for which there is nothing valuable to show?
Can the smooth, and glossy, and sweetly-scented
Connolly, or Wetmore, (or Busteed
and his kinsman, Doane,) or Nathan, or Nelson
tell us? Of course they can, as they were the
corrupt disbursers of this prodigious plunder.
Speak, then, ye infernal robbers of the toiling
millions, whom ye bamboozle, and starve, and
disease, and jam, and ram, and smother in cellars
and attics and tenement houses, and whose
devoted wives and virgin daughters you drive
unto prostitution for food and rent and medicine
and apparel. You consummate these pernicious
wrongs and oppressions through your
Janus and Judas professions of democracy,
which no more resemble Jefferson’s, Madison’s,
Calhoun’s and Jackson’s political creed,
than your sleek hair, and fancy apparel, and
thievish propensities resemble the simple garb
and integrity of those democratic legions,
whose votes you literally steal through your
honied political heresies, and the lavish expenditure
of the very money you steal from
the people, through such jobs as the Record
printing. With fast horses, wines, and costly
gluttony, and daubed all over with pomatum,
you revel high in your dazzling Persian Pavilions,
whose construction and gilded furniture,
and luscious viands, are stolen directly
from the honorable and deluded millions.
These are truths, and we will proclaim them
from the steeples of the metropolis, and strive
to arouse a people who slumber on the confines
of volcanoes, while thieves, and rapes,
and incendiaries, and midnight assassins are
softly crawling towards their throats. Your
perjured alienage we might extenuate, but
your robbery of the honest and laborious
masses we will expose and combat, if we rot
in the dungeons of Blackwell’s or Sing Sing.
The purest editors of this thievish age are too
pliable, and politic, and mercenary for the
public welfare; but we will dissect your robbery,
if we are crucified with spikes, and our
limbs are chopped and hacked with a butcher’s
axe, and our flesh, blood, bones and marrow
burned to cinders, and our ashes cast upon the
whirlwind for annihilation. The axe and faggot
we defy. God only do we fear. So, come on, ye
teeming caverns of infernal thieves, and seize,
and incarcerate, and butcher, and strive to
annihilate our mortal scabbard, but you shall
not have the soul, which will elude your
wicked and revengeful grasp, and have eternal
succor in the realms of purity and bliss, if, in
its mortal pilgrimage, it be true to God and
his pilfered, oppressed, and misanthropic children.</p>

<h2>Ice Cream.</h2>

<p class="p2">Under the genial, affable, and generous Joseph
Gales, of the National Intelligencer,
James Watson Webb is the senior editor of our
country, and James Gordon Bennett is close
at his heels, whose venerable and majestic
forms will soon descend the dismal steps of
the tomb, and their extraordinary souls appear
in the awful presence of a Judge, from
whom there is no appeal. Solemn thought!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
and almost paralysing in its contemplation.
Webb was born in America, and Bennett on
the mountains of Scotland, where one of his
parents survives, to enjoy the success and protection
of her faithful son. With James Watson
Webb we never exchanged a word, which
we can scarcely realise in view of our intimate
relations, for twenty years, with other metropolitan
editors. But with James Gordon Bennett
we have had the closest relations, and we
proclaim, with no ordinary emotions of pleasure,
that he has treated us more like a brother
than a stranger. In our memorable mnemotechnic
controversy with Professor Francis Fauvel
Gouraud, in 1843, when almost every editor
in America was arrayed against us, and eternal
ruin seemed inevitable, James Gordon
Bennett came to our rescue, and, with George
W. Kendall, of the New Orleans Picayune,
George D. Prentice, of the Louisville Journal,
and Mrs. Walters, of the Boston Transcript,
we were sublimely victorious in that scholastic
disputation. In consideration of his magnanimous
conduct, we wrote to the <i>Herald</i>
about one hundred columns from Panama and
California, when the civilized world was rocked,
to its profoundest basis, with the dazzling
gold discoveries, and on our return, he gave us
money, and ever cheered us in our illness and
penury. When we wrote the inflammatory
Report of the noble Alfred Carson, against the
Common Council of 1850, we gave it to Mr.
Bennett, to the exclusion of the other editors,
because he had been true in our adversity,
when the hands of all mankind seemed uplifted
to annihilate our pale and feeble frame.
We had boarded with Horace Greeley, for
seven years, at the Graham House, in Barclay
street, and all our relations had been of the
most friendly character; and yet we deemed
it our sacred duty to send our Pilgrim letters
to Mr. Bennett, and also give him Carson’s
famous Report, to the exclusion of Greeley,
because Bennett’s fidelity was next to our
Father’s. Greeley was a formidable candidate
for the Mayoralty, when Carson’s Report appeared,
and if we had given it to him instead
of Bennett, he would have been the successor
of Mayor Woodhull. But in giving it to Bennett
for publication one day in advance of
Greeley, so exasperated the latter against Carson
and ourself, that he attacked the Report
like a ferocious bull dog, and slew himself,
whose name was hardly whispered in the
Mayoralty Convention that soon followed.
Alderman Morgan Morgans, (President of the
Board of Aldermen,) Alderman Robert H.
Hawes, Alderman George H. Franklin, and
Mayor Woodhull himself were also candidates.
But as they were all severely denounced
in Carson’s Report, for discharging
culprits without examination or trial, and for
other offences common to Aldermen in those
days, they were all rejected by the Convention,
when the oily Ambrose C. Kingsland entered
the arena, and was nominated and easily
elected, which proved to be the saddest municipal
calamity of that period, as he was in
collusion throughout his term with official
scoundrels, and made more money than any
Mayor who preceded him, as one of our Aldermanic
pupils often assured us; and if Kingsland
will publicly deny our accusations, we
will adduce our informant’s name, and paralyse
him. And to be briefly explicit, our informant
was connected with Kingsland and
Draper’s operations to rob the city of the
Gansevoort property. Kingsland’s appointment
of Matsell as Chief of Police partially
corroborates the assertion of the Alderman
who imparted his precious information. Kingsland’s
appointment of Matsell was effected thus:
According to his custom, with Mayors elect,
Matsell invited Kingsland to a ride into the Metropolitan
suburbs, on the morning after his
election, and in passing a gaudy edifice, the
Brandon Chieftain halted and exclaimed:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
“Kingsland, my boy, is not that a fascinating
mansion?” Kingsland crimsoned, and gazed
rapiers and scabbards, and in baffled accents,
mildly ejaculated in the expressive language of
Jemmy Twitcher: “Vell, vot of it?” “O,
nothing,&mdash;only I thought I would inquire how
you enjoyed yourself in its rainbow halls on
Friday evening last. And, by the way, how
about the appointment of Chief of Police?
Have you resolved whom to appoint?” “Certainly
I have. You well know my ancient
love for you, and that you are my choice for
Chief, beyond any being living or dead. I was
elected to eject you, but I shan’t do it, my
boy. ‘Thou art the man!’ Ha, ha, ha! Give
us your hand, old boy. Ha, ha, ha! A very
fine day, ain’t it Matsell?” “Kingsland, you
have really got a magnificent Palace in the
Fifth Avenue, but I think your front parlor
requires a five thousand dollar clock, to render
it thoroughly gorgeous and enchanting.”
“Chief, what in the name of mud are you
driving at?” “I am driving for my life to
Burnham’s, for his choicest brandy and Ice
Cream.”</p>

<h2>Our Country’s Ruin.</h2>

<p class="p2">The seed of wide-spread corruption is culminating
here, at Albany, and Washington,
with the velocity of light, (which is about two
hundred thousand miles per second,) which
may rend the Union to fragments during the
present generation. And the present leaders
of parties will be the immediate cause of our
country’s downfall, through their sly winks
and blinks at the robbers of their respective
parties, to seize the public booty to elect their
municipal, State, and national officers. Horace
Greeley, with all his professions of purity,
justice and humanity, will shield an anti-slavery
thief at every peril of his conscience, and
scourge the thieves of all other parties like
Tacitus, or Diogenes, and so will the leaders of
the American and Democratic parties. It is
not the struggle for the boundaries of slavery
and freedom that will rend this Union to
atoms, but the miserable, thievish, aspiring,
and traffic politicians who use the Negro and
Satan, to seize the public treasure and official
honors. It is the ungodly grab of lazy men
for gilded booty, to enable them to revel in
indolence, and control the elections and magic
wires of all the parties, that will consummate
our dissolution and eternal ruin. And Greeley
and Bryant know this, and so does that puritannical,
mercenary, penurious, white handkerchief’d,
and stiff-necked old Presbyterian,
Gerard Hallock, of the Journal of
Commerce, and those thieves of thieves,
and Catalinian conspirators, and overshadowing
plunderers, Simeon Draper and
Thurlow Weed, whom God, or man, or
fiend should drive to the wilderness, or
smite from the face of the earth, and, if possible,
from its profoundest bowels. For their
stabs at the heart of our free institutions, and
their pernicious example to the youth of this
generation, they should be hurled from the
summit of the Rocky mountains. There is no
honor or patriotism in these demons. If there
were, they would rally like our Fathers for
the preservation of our glorious Union, and
the Municipal, State and National Treasuries,
whose plunder they counsel and shield in the
infamous persons of their political confederates,
and share their spoils in darkness, with
only the Devil present, but the Great Invisible
in the awful distance, whose retribution will be
terrible when it comes, beyond the grave;
and worms may partially devour their vile
carcases, before they die, as with Biddle and
Nero, and Caliglula. All leaders of parties
are plunderers, and thus directly advocate the
subversion of our liberties and the public dishonor.
God, alone, from the Revolution to
the present hour, has shielded the Americans<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
from foreign and domestic adversaries, with
his beneficent arms expanded over our fertile
vales, and fields, and plains, and forests, and
noble mountains, and has rescued us from the
Burrs and Arnolds, and Goths and Vandals,
who strive to paralise our progress in a pure and
sacred civilization. But our disunion and
subversion are as inevitable as the advent of
the morning sun, unless some Washington, or
Cincinnatus, or Brutus the First come forth,
and stab the incarnate devils down, and trample
their worthless bodies in the dust. Thieves,
rapes, incendiaries, assassins, and traitors teem
like the Egyptian locusts throughout our borders,
and the odious vices, and bloody strife,
and crumbling ruins, and all the horrors and
havoc and universal chaos of the Roman Empire,
and other ancient States, will be our
awful doom, unless the wisdom, and virtue,
and firmness of our country rally in the Forum,
and impart the principles of integrity and patriotism
to the people, and immolate the leading
scoundrels and traitors of the age. Thus
only can we avert the overshadowing evils
that flit like midnight spectres through every
street and habitation, and will soon spread
through every meritorious fireside. And thus
only can we avert the execrations of our posterity,
for being recreant to the Roman Fathers
of the Revolution, and for not resisting with
our lives, the barbarians of the present generation.</p>

<h2>Dev’l-in a Bakery.</h2>

<p class="p2">Hawes, the New York baker, says: “Branch,
do you know Charley Devlin?” “Yes.” “Well,
Branch, I was a baker apprentice with him,
and also a journeyman. He was burned and
floated out of his bakery in the Fourth Ward
some years since, and he desired to bake for
his customers in my oven until his own was
repaired. I, of course, consented. Subsequently,
he became a primary politician, and
for several years past has besought me to sell
my bakery, and become a contractor. I hesitated
for a long period, but last year, (finding
that he had acquired wealth very fast,) I resolved
to dispose of my bakery, and join him
as a contractor. A neighbor learned my purpose,
who assured me that, to his sorrow, in
early life he was a politician, and that if I
joined Devlin as a contractor, I would be compelled
to take at least three false oaths a day
throughout the year, (for which people are
sent to States Prison ten years, and forever
lose their suffrage,) which so alarmed me, that
I abandoned my intention and narrowly escaped
the portals of a dungeon, and the loss
of my patronage as a baker, and my reputation
as an honorable man, for which I devoutly
thank the Great Disposer of Events.”
We congratulated our honest friend Hawes,
and warned him to beware of the Dev’l-in a
bakery.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Happy Family.</span>&mdash;How cunning for
Peter Cooper and Mayor Tiemann to send
Hopeful to the Democratic General Committee,
and beat Elijah F. Purdy by one vote for
Chairman; and then for Daniel and Edward
(the sons of Peter) to turn up Mayor and
Street Commissioner. It is the more cunning,
as Peter Cooper and Daniel F. Tiemann have
held Municipal offices since 1828, and now,
with Hopeful, have two of the most lucrative
and honorable offices in America. In view of
all this, Peter can well afford to give two or
three upper stories of a Bowery edifice to the
city for educational purposes, without feeling
it very keenly. Besides, the immortality of
the gift is of some moment. Verily, the Tiemanns
and Coopers should be a very Happy
Family; and if Death do not confuse and
thwart their successful and extraordinary tactics,
as with poor Joseph S. Taylor, (who, with
all his faults, had a heart as big as a mountain,)
they will doubtless acquire sufficient
from the public teats, which they have sucked
so long, to render them comfortable in
their superannuation.</p>

<h2>For Pale Students, and Romantic Virgins.</h2>

<p class="p2">In 1780, Washington defrayed the educational
expenses of a youth, who was an immediate
descendent of Pocahontas, and procured
his passage to Scotland, where he became a
student in its noble highlands. In his class
were two youths, whom he loved with enthusiastic
fondness. One was from Damascus,
and the other from the Oriental Empire, who
was born beneath the native village skies of
Confucius, to whom he traced his blood. On
the eve of graduation, and just prior to their
departure for the remotest portions of the
globe, they fondly rambled in the woods and
groves, where they oft had wandered, and ascended
majestic mountains, on whose celestial
peaks, (with the pale moon in her zenith roaming,)
they sung these pensive lines, in their favorite
Alpine bowers:</p>

<p class="ppn4 p1">When shall we three meet again?<br />
When shall we three meet again?<br />
Oft shall glowing hope expire;<br />
Oft shall wearied love retire;<br />
Oft shall death and sorrow reign,<br />
Ere we three do meet again.</p>

<p class="ppn4 p1">Though in distant lands we sigh,<br />
Parched beneath a hostile sky;<br />
Though the deep between us rolls,<br />
Friendship shall unite our souls;<br />
Long may this loved bower remain;<br />
Here may we three meet again.</p>

<p class="ppn4 p1">When the dreams of life have fled;<br />
When its wasted lamp is dead;<br />
When in cold oblivion’s shade,<br />
Beauty, wealth and power are laid;<br />
Where immortal spirits reign,<br />
There may we three meet again.</p>

<p class="p1">They soon departed for their respective
countries, and never met again! Alas!</p>

<p class="ppn4 p1">“The human heart, like the muffled drum,<br />
Is ever beating funeral marches to the grave!”</p>

<p>The following was written, in 1854, by Stephen
H. Branch, for Ald. Orison Blunt, then
Alderman of the Third Ward, but is now
Supervisor from the Fifteenth Ward:</p>

<p>Captain Robert Creighton: Sir: I am authorized
by the Corporation of the City of
New York to extend to you the Freedom of
the City, together with a gold box, as a testimonial
of their regard for you. I might
linger on the thrilling incidents connected
with your fidelity to suffering humanity,
from the moment you discovered the San
Francisco, until you rescued from a watery
grave, more than 200 distracted beings. I
might touchingly allude to your tears from
day to day, as witnessed by your sailors, because
you could not sooner relieve the unfortunate.
I might speak of the fearful responsibility
you assumed in violating the insurance
of your ship and valuable cargo, by deviating
from your specific course; of your
fearful perils amid the howling tempest;
of the four inch stream of water pouring
in upon you, which caused both
pumps to be constantly wrought before
you discovered the wreck; of the disadvantages
of four hundred tons of iron, and large
quantities of merchandise, in a ship of only
seven hundred tons burthen; of the loss of
every sail before you saw the wreck, save
your foresail and mainsail. I might dwell on
these historical truths, and on your affectionate
regard for the rescued, but I forbear. All
this, and even more, is on every tongue, and
uttered around every fireside, and cannot be
glorified by me. The contemplation of the
good you have effected will ever be a delightful
solace to you, and your humanity will be
a precious inheritance to your consanguinity.
The wives and children of those whose lives
you have preserved will ever love you, and
transmit your name to their farthest posterity.
The mariners of every ocean will strive
to imitate your meritorious example. The
noble youth of our country will read of your
heroic deeds, and resolve to emulate
your manly virtues. Little children already
lisp your name in terms of praise. Tears of
gratitude are freely shed for you by either
sex, and fervent prayers go up to Heaven
from the habitations of all this land, that your
valuable life may be long preserved, and that
health, happiness, and prosperity may ever be
your lot. And your name will be revered by
coming generations, when every being who
beholds the sun of this day, shall be a tenant
of the tomb!</p>

like cliffs and promontories all over his skull.
Will always desire to pay his debts before

and impulsive to the 90th degree, and
have marvellous compunction. Will never be
rude nor impolite, nor snatch candy from
other boys, although his bump of snatchitiveness
may grow in wild Irish luxuriance, or
through Catalinian pomatum, which may
cause him to snatch pap from his Mummy’s
breast, (while she is serenely snoozing, to recruit
from his unreasonable demand for pap,)
which may nourish and increase his hillock of
diminutive snatchitiveness, and cause him to
snatch like Bobby Morris, and thunder and

always be poor, from his too moderate and
compunctive legal fees.</p>
